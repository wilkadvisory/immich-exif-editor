# Remaining Updates Needed

I've completed making the folder browser full height by moving the selection count to the header.

Here are the remaining changes you requested. I'll provide you with an updated complete file shortly.

## Changes to Implement:

### 1. ✅ Folder Browser Full Height  
**STATUS:** COMPLETE  
The selection label has been moved from the bottom (row 2) to the header, making the browser take full vertical space.

### 2. 🔄 Address Search Bar for Map
**NEEDED:** Add a search entry above the map widget to search for addresses
Example: "3 Stoneham St, Joondanna"

### 3. 🔄 Square Map (Width = Height)
**NEEDED:** Make map container square by calculating its width and setting height equal

### 4. 🔄 Date Picker Button
**NEEDED:** Add calendar popup button next to date entry field

### 5. 🔄 Time Picker Button  
**NEEDED:** Add time picker popup next to time entry field

### 6. 🔄 Change Time Format to HH:MM
**NEEDED:**  
- Change placeholder from "HH:MM:SS" to "HH:MM"
- Auto-add ":00" for seconds when parsing

## Creating Complete Updated File...

Due to file size, I'll create the complete updated version and present it to you.
